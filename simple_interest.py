#complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T)
# ( I ) is the interest earned,
# ( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
# ( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
# ( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

p = principal
r = rate
t = time

i = p*r*t

print(f"The simple interest is: {i}")
